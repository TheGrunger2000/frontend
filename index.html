                                <p>
                                    Chicago, officially the City of Chicago, is the most populous city in the U.S. state of Illinois,
                                    and the third most populous city in the United States.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    With an estimated population of 2,705,994 (2018), it is also the most populous city
                                    in the Midwestern United States. Chicago is the county seat of Cook County,
                                    the second most populous county in the US, with a small portion of the northwest side
                                    of the city extending into DuPage County near O'Hare Airport. Chicago is the principal
                                    city of the Chicago metropolitan area, often referred to as Chicagoland. At nearly 10 million people,
                                    the metropolitan area is the third most populous in the United States. 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Located on the shores of freshwater Lake Michigan, Chicago was incorporated 
                                    as a city in 1837 near a portage between the Great Lakes and the Mississippi River
                                    watershed and grew rapidly in the mid-19th century. After the Great Chicago Fire of 1871,
                                    which destroyed several square miles and left more than 100,000 homeless, the city made
                                    a concerted effort to rebuild. The construction boom accelerated population growth throughout
                                    the following decades, and by 1900, less than 30 years after the great fire, 
                                    Chicago was the fifth-largest city in the world. Chicago made noted contributions to urban planning
                                    and zoning standards, including new construction styles (including the Chicago School of architecture),
                                    the development of the City Beautiful Movement, and the steel-framed skyscraper.
                                </p>

                                    Chicago is an international hub for finance, culture, commerce, industry, education, technology,
                                    telecommunications, and transportation. It is the site of the creation of the first standardized
                                    futures contracts, issued by the Chicago Board of Trade, which today is the largest and most diverse
                                    derivatives market in the world, generating 20% of all volume in commodities and financial futures alone.
                                    Depending on the particular year, the city's O'Hare International Airport is routinely ranked as 
                                    the world's fifth or sixth busiest airport according to tracked data by the Airports Council
                                    International.

                                    The region also has the largest number of federal highways and is the nation's railroad hub.
                                    Chicago was listed as an alpha global city by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network, and
                                    it ranked seventh in the entire world in the 2017 Global Cities Index. The Chicago area has one of the
                                    highest gross domestic products (GDP) in the world, generating $689 billion in 2018. In addition, the city 
                                    has one of the world's most diversified and balanced economies, with no single industry employing 
                                    more than 14% of the workforce. Chicago is home to several Fortune 500 companies, including Allstate,
                                    Boeing, Exelon, Kraft Heinz, McDonald's, Mondelez International, Sears, United Airlines Holdings, and Walgreens.

                                    Chicago's 58 million domestic and international visitors in 2018 made it the second most visited city 
                                    in the nation, as compared with New York City's 65 million visitors in 2018. The city was ranked first
                                    in the 2018 Time Out City Life Index, a global quality of life survey of 15,000 people in 32 cities.
                                    Landmarks in the city include Millennium Park, Navy Pier, the Magnificent Mile, the Art Institute
                                    of Chicago, Museum Campus, the Willis (Sears) Tower, Grant Park, the Museum of Science and Industry,
                                    and Lincoln Park Zoo.

                                            Receiving millions of visitors annually, the Willis Tower (formerly known as Sears Tower) 
                                            is one of Chicago’s most popular attractions. It is the second tallest building in 
                                            the Western Hemisphere. On a clear day, visitors can see four states from the Skydeck: 
                                            Illinois, Indiana, Wisconsin, and Michigan.

                                            Where did the idea of putting paint in a can with a spray tip come from? Chicago paint salesman
                                            Ed Seymour actually invented this artistic substance, which is now used to create colorful works 
                                            in public spaces all over the city.

                                        <p>
                                            Chicagoan Jimmy Dewar worked as a manager at the famed Hostess Brands factory. During that time, 
                                            Dewar wanted to create a pastry that was filled with cream. His invention, the Twinkie, launched
                                            in 1930 and was named after an ad for “Twinkle Toe Shoes” that Dewar came across.
                                            The original Twinkie was filled with banana cream, but was replaced with vanilla cream during WWII
                                            when bananas became scarce.

                                            Chicago’s own NBC 5 Chicago/WMAQ television station has a rich history of innovation. After many months
                                            of hard work, the channel became the first all-color station in the world on April 15, 1956.
                                            Later, the station became the city’s first commercial station to broadcast in stereo in September 1986.

                                            Flowing through downtown Chicago, the Chicago River has a fascinating history. Not only does this river
                                            run through various systems and canals, but it is also the only river in the world that flows backwards.
                                            A reversal technique was introduced for sanitation reasons to divert the sewage away from Lake Michigan’s
                                            water supply. The reversal of the river was recognized as being the largest public earth-moving project
                                            ever completed. It was also acknowledged as a great engineering achievement.
